# StudySync Project Deliverables

## Project Overview

**StudySync** is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the college student experience by enhancing group study, note-sharing, and exam preparation. Addressing the challenges of coordinating study groups and managing academic resources in hybrid or remote learning environments, StudySync integrates real-time collaboration, AI-driven tools, and progress tracking into a single platform. Built with a modern tech stack (Next.js, PostgreSQL, Socket.io, APIs).

The following deliverables outline the core components and functionalities of the StudySync web application, ensuring a comprehensive, scalable, and user-focused solution.
